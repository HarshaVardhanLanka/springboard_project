            "Based on the provided research data, deep learning models are being proposed for the automatic diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis using eye fundus images, with the goal of enhancing diagnostic accuracy over traditional methods. These systems have been evaluated on cloud platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud (Vertex AI). However, a significant challenge in developing these clinical AI tools is model generalization, as biases in training data can lead to inaccurate predictions and serious negative consequences for patients. The research highlights this as a fundamental machine learning problem, pointing toward the need for principled algorithmic approaches and further study into generalization within the small sample sizes typical of clinical applications.\n"
